# StepmaniaConverter
A program which converts osu!mania beatmaps (.osu) into stepcharts (.sm)

## Usage
On first startup it will request to search for your osu! executable directory as well as your stepmania songs directory
osu! location should be in %Appdata%\..\Local\osu!
stepmania songs should be in (stepmania dir)\Songs

It will request for a folder which contains the .osu beatmap(s) and necessary data (audio file and bg)

Select the folder and it will automatically write the converted beatmaps as stepcharts into (stepmania dir)\Songs\OsuConverts\(artist name) - (song name)
